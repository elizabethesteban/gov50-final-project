## Project thoughts

As of right now, I don't have a specific topic I'd like to focus on. Some topics that do interest me are the influence of the US with cartels(organized crime) in Mexico: Gun Control. Another topic would be the factors that lead immigrants on fleeing their countries(specifically Latin America), their journey to the US-Mexico Border, the disappearances of many immigrants, and dive deeper into immigration preferences in the US.
